Elephants: A Comprehensive Guide
Elephants (order Proboscidea, family Elephantidae) are the largest land mammals on Earth and represent a pinnacle of terrestrial evolution in terms of size. These remarkable creatures have captivated human imagination for millennia and continue to play crucial roles in their ecosystems as keystone species. Their extraordinary intelligence, complex social structures, and unique physiological adaptations make them one of the most fascinating subjects in zoology.

Species and Classification
There are three recognized species of elephants:

African Bush Elephant (Loxodonta africana)
