  Follow these guidelines to optimize the query:
  1. Remove unnecessary words or phrases that don't contribute to the core meaning.
  2. Identify and emphasize key concepts or entities.
  3. Use more specific or technical terms if appropriate.
  4. Ensure the query is clear and concise.
  5. Maintain the original intent of the query.
  
  Output only the refined query text, without any additional explanation or formatting, on a single line:`,
